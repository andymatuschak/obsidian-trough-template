This is an Obsidian plugin template, designed for use in another plugin which allows the user to generate Obsidian plugins from within Obsidian, using natural language. Assume that the user can supply zero or minimal technical intervention. You've got to make the whole thing work yourself, from start to finish.

Use `npm install` to install any necessary packages.

Once you think you're done with necessary changes, run `npm run build` to build the plugin. Fix any errors which appear.

If the user asks for a change to Obsidian's editor itself, assume they mean the "live editor", which uses CodeMirror. So you'll be writing a CodeMirror extension.
